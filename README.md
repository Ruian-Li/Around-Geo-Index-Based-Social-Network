# NBA-Shot-Chart
React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization 
- Created a dashboard using React, D3 and Ant Design backed by API from stats.nba.com to visualize individual playerâ€™s shot data, including a shot chart and user profile view
- Created 4 extra filters and 2 shot themes (hexbin and scatter) to provide more customized visualization on the shot chart
